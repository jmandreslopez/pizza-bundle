Symfony2 Pizza Sample Bundle
============================

Bundle that simulates a pizza place. In which allows the user to pre-register by using the phone number. Once the client is identified proceeds to order pizza. 

Only for practical purposes: It is a pizza place that has only one type of pizza with three different ingredients and in three different sizes.

Thanks Yali Legorreta for the design.
